     <!--Description-->
     <h4>Cherry tarts are one of the many summer delights that are enjoyed by many fans around the world.<br>They can be served warm or chilled, and can also be served with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of chocolate shavings.</h4>

     <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
     <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
     <li>1 pound fresh sweet cherries, pitted</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons minute tapioca</li>
     <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
     <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
     <li>1 pinch salt</li>

    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pie crusts on a lightly floured surface and roll out each crust with a rolling pin, so it is large enough to cut three 5 to 5-1/2-inch circles, for a total of 6 tart crusts.</li>
        <br><li>Fit each dough circle into a 4-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Press the dough against the sides of the pans, and prick the bottom with a fork to prevent bubbling. Remove any excess dough by running the rolling pin across the top of each pan.</li>
        <br><li>Refrigerate tart crusts until well chilled, about 45 minutes, keeping them refrigerated until ready to use.</li>
        <br><li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br><li>In a large bowl, combine cherries, tapioca, sugar, almond extract, and salt. Remove the pans from the fridge and distribute cherry mixture evenly among the tart pans. Place the pans on a baking sheet.</li>
        <br><li>Bake in the preheated oven until cherries are soft and crust is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
